# NumberPuzzle
In this project, I implement the number puzzle game. This is the game where we have a board of 4 by 4 filled with numbers from 1 to 15 and the last block is empty. You have to click on one of the buttons that is adjacent to the empty block, so it moves it to the empty block. In my setting fragment, I have two settings options which are text color and block color. You can change it and it will save it for next match until you change it again. In my config fragment, I have a recycler view which has 3 card view displaying easy, medium, and hard. Easy is where the first two rows are done for you, medium is the first row done, and hard is where it randomize everything. I also have two animation sets called “glow.xml” and “winning.xml” for the buttons. If you click on the button it will make it looks like you clicked it. And, if you play the game and win, the board turns white and rotate. If you surrender nothing happens. My ViewModel is to track the option in settings so all fragments can access. I think I have fulfilled every requirement.
